Generating the supercell .xyz file.

The following arguments will be passed to the CIF reader script:
./Read_CIF.py -i Benzene.cif -o Benzene.xyz -b 5 5 5

Generating monomers for all complete molecules in the supercell:

Currently, the center of the supercell is located at:
x =   34.06501
y =   43.70734
z =   32.08379

The supercell coordinates will be translated and centered on the origin.

The BFS algorithm found 7 monomers in the supercell in 2.99 s
