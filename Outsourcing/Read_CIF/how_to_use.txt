No installation is necessary, just make sure that the "pycifrw-4.1.1-min"
directory and the "read_cif.py" file are in the same directory.

As a test, you could run:

    ./read_cif.py -i quartz-alpha.cif -o quartz-222.cif -b 2 2 2

and then look at the resulting CIF file with JMol:

    jmol quartz-222.cif

In a similar way the script can generate GROMACS and LAMMPS files that can be
used to start a Molecular Dynamics simulation.
